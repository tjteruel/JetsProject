## Jets Project (Week 3 Skill Distillery)

###Overview

This is the Jets Project application. It utilizes a text file with containing a list of 5 unique jets that include the model, speed, range, and price. These 5 jets are then added into a list. A menu is displayed where a user can list all the jets, fly all the jets, see the fastest jet, see the jet with the farthest range, load all jets that are cargo jets, and fight all the fighter jets. The user can also add a jet to the fleet by selecting the type of jet and inputting the corresponding data, or remove a jet from the fleet. The jet list is then updated with the user choices allowing the user to use all menu options with the jets in the fleet.

### Lessons Learned
I learned about abstract classes and interfaces throughout this project. The use of multiple classes with various relationships resulted in a clean product that reduced the amount of repeating code. Working alongside my classmates on this project allowed us to tackle problems with different point of views and come up with various solutions. Through the help of my classmates I was able to grasp concept I previously struggled with expand my knowledge base of Java.
